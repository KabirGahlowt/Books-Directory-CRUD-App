# Books-Directory-CRUD-App
This project was created as a learning exercise to understand and practice the fundamentals of Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB by building a full-stack CRUD application. It demonstrates how to create RESTful APIs, interact with a database, and build a simple interactive frontend using vanilla JavaScript.
